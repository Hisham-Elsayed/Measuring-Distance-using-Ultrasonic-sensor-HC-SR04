# Measuring-Distance-using-Ultrasonic-sensor-HC-SR04

Using ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.

The projec is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture model.

The ICU is configured with frequency F_CPU/8 and is used to detect the raising 
edge as the first edge.

4x16 LCD with 8-bits data mode.

Implemented a full ultrasonic Driver using ATmega16 ICU driver.
